# CH341A-Pro2

Originally by Upcycle-Electronics, thanks to him! (https://github.com/Upcycle-Electronics/CH341A-Pro)

I've added a voltage selection jumper, swap the memory orientation (to follow the last software revision) and removed the "useless" serial I/O.
For now, this version haven't been tested... Please be advice!
